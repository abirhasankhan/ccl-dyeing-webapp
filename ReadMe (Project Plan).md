### Project Plan: ERP Web App for Factory Dyeing Process Tracking

#### **Phase 1: Planning and Requirement Gathering**
1. **Define Functional Requirements:**
   - Track dyeing processes, including raw material input, dyeing stages, and output.
   - Provide user roles (Admin, Operator, Manager).
   - Generate reports (daily, weekly, monthly).
   - Real-time status updates.
   - Integration with factory machinery (if applicable).

2. **Define Non-Functional Requirements:**
   - High performance with concurrent users.
   - Scalable and modular architecture.
   - Secure access and data handling.
   - Deployed on DigitalOcean for cost efficiency.

3. **Prepare Development Environment:**
   - Install PostgreSQL and Node.js locally.
   - Setup DigitalOcean account for deployment.
   - Install required tools (e.g., Docker, VSCode, Git).

---

#### **Phase 2: Database Setup**
1. **Review and Refactor Raw SQL Database Model:**
   - Analyze existing SQL model and identify tables, relationships, and constraints.
   - Adjust table names, fields, and indexes for ORM compatibility.

2. **Convert SQL to ORM (Using Sequelize):**
   - Set up Sequelize in the backend Node.js project.
   - Create models for each table with proper associations.
   - Validate the ORM schema against the raw SQL schema.

3. **Implement Migrations and Seeders:**
   - Write Sequelize migrations for schema setup.
   - Create seeders for initial data population.

---

#### **Phase 3: Backend Development**
1. **Set Up Node.js Backend:**
   - Initialize the Node.js project with `Express.js` for API routing.
   - Install dependencies:
     ```
     npm install express sequelize pg pg-hstore dotenv cors body-parser
     ```

2. **Develop API Endpoints:**
   - Create RESTful endpoints for:
     - User authentication and role-based access control.
     - CRUD operations for dyeing process data.
     - Generating reports and exporting data.
     - Real-time updates (WebSocket or polling).

3. **Integrate ORM with API:**
   - Use Sequelize models for database queries in API logic.

4. **Testing:**
   - Write unit and integration tests using `Jest` or `Mocha`.

---

#### **Phase 4: Frontend Development**
1. **Set Up React.js Frontend:**
   - Initialize the React project with Vite or Create React App.
   - Install dependencies:
     ```
     npm install axios react-router-dom tailwindcss
     ```

2. **Develop UI Components:**
   - Dashboard for tracking dyeing processes.
   - User management interface.
   - Real-time status tracking with visualizations (charts, graphs).
   - Form components for data entry.

3. **State Management:**
   - Use Context API or Redux for global state management.

4. **Connect Frontend to Backend:**
   - Use Axios for API calls.
   - Handle authentication using JWT.

5. **Frontend Testing:**
   - Test UI with tools like React Testing Library and Cypress.

---

#### **Phase 5: Deployment**
1. **Prepare Deployment Environment:**
   - Create a PostgreSQL database instance on DigitalOcean.
   - Set up a Node.js server instance.

2. **Deploy Backend:**
   - Use Docker for containerizing the Node.js application.
   - Push the backend to a DigitalOcean droplet.

3. **Deploy Frontend:**
   - Build the React app and host it on DigitalOcean App Platform or Nginx.

4. **Set Up CI/CD Pipeline:**
   - Use GitHub Actions or Jenkins for automated deployment.

5. **Domain and SSL Setup:**
   - Purchase a custom domain and configure it with DigitalOcean DNS.
   - Install SSL using Letâ€™s Encrypt.

---

#### **Phase 6: Monitoring and Maintenance**
1. **Implement Monitoring:**
   - Use tools like New Relic or Prometheus to monitor performance.
   - Set up logging with tools like Winston or ELK Stack.

2. **Collect Feedback:**
   - Get user feedback for improvements.

3. **Continuous Updates:**
   - Regularly add features and improve performance.
   - Update dependencies and security patches.

---

#### **Phase 7: Documentation**
1. **Developer Documentation:**
   - API documentation using Swagger.
   - ORM model schema and relationships.

2. **User Documentation:**
   - Guides for using the web app.
   - Troubleshooting FAQs.

3. **Training:**
   - Train factory staff on how to use the web app.
